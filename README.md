# Secure Chat Application

## Background

This project is a secure chat application designed to provide encrypted communication using advanced cryptographic techniques. It incorporates functionalities such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange for establishing a shared secret, AES-256 for encryption, and HMAC for message integrity and authentication. The application is built with the intent to demonstrate secure communication principles in a networked environment.
